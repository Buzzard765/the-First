# Tycoon-Game-Project

Hi everyone, my name is Bhaswara.

This is my first upload on Github. A prototype of a Tycoon like-game. 
i know, it's heavily based on Indonesian Cuisine...because that was 
the first idea that came out from my head. so far i planned to release
it on web browser. Future updates may be released, but i dunno if 
that's possible...it seems it can't put the entire project in it

The Inspiration cames from a local game in my town called Tahu Bulat,
but it was also inspired from Lemonade Tycoon. your main goal is
basically to give customer the exact cuisine from their order,
and serve all the customer for one timeshift: morning, afternoon,
evening, or even night. you can also buy ingredients while the 
restaurant is "still open" to create the cuisine.

so far it's still relative small game, so i haven't think of improvement
that will spruce the game
